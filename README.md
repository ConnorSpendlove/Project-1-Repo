## Description
This project was built using 2 API's; CheapShark and GamerPower. The purpose of the website is to pull 2 very useful API's into one. The site is separated into 3 different pages. A landing page, a page that displays games on sale from CheapShark's API and a third page that displays games, beta keys, and DLC's that are free from the GamerPower API. This project presented a challenge as it was the first time any of us worked in a group and we ran into the dreaded merge conflict. The deals page operates by storefronts so a user can see 15 games on sale on all 12 storefronts that CheapShark pulls from and the free games section filters into games, DLC, and beta keys that are free.

## Usage
Simply click the "View Free games", "View Deals", & "Home" buttons to navigate to the different sections of the website. All games have a link that can be clicked to redirect the user to the proper storefront so they can easily access their free or discounted games.
